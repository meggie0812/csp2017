     <p>Welcome to my website! This is the website I am currently working on in
     my computer science class. I will keep updating the projects in my CSP
     class here. If you want to visit them feel free to go to "about me" page!
     So far, all the projects I have done are on Scratch and App Inventor. You 
     are more than welcome to play the games! Also, I might post some of the
     photos I like here and some interesting things I found in my life here. I
     would like to share what I like with you and hope you enjoy it!
     </p>
     
      <p>Here are some movies I like:</p>
