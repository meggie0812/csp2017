      <p>Hello and welcome! My name is Meggie Liu. Iâ€™ve finally became a 
      sophomore this year! (On the other hand, there are approximately 2 years 
      left till graduation for me TwT. )
      </p>
      <p>
I come from Guangzhou, which is a city located in the very south of China. 
Guangzhou is a city that right next to Southern China Sea and has warm, moist
weather throughout the year. 
      </p>
       <p>
I am multilingual and I speak Cantonese, Mandarin, English, and I understand 
Hakka (a dialect that is frequently used in southeastern China). I am also 
taking French 2 this year. Fun fact: Cantonese was the first language I had ever
learned in my life! I started learning Mandarin systematically in 1st grade. I 
came to the U.S. after I finished 7th grade and I am still improving my English. 
If you ever found problems about my English, you are more than welcome to let me
know and correct me!
  </p>
 <p>
I like drawing and designing. And I am currently trying painting with 
watercolor. I love making pottery. I really enjoy the process when I shape a 
chunk of mud into something new and finally color it to make a pottery creation. 
The possibility of argil could be infinite and that's what fascinating me. I 
like swimming even I am not a good swimmer. I also enjoy riding a bike and 
playing badminton. Classic music and Kpop music are my favorite music types. 
 </p>
      <p>
Thank you for your time to read all the way here and I hope you enjoy!
