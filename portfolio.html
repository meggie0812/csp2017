            Hello and welcome! This is my first remix project. Based on the original starter
            my partner Chloe and me We added four new sprites, three new blocks, two new instruments,
            one new song, names of notes, and directions to the original starter. You are more than welcome 
            to explore it! In this project, you can see a simulative piano keyboard. You can either free play 
            or click on the "piano" icon or the "flute" icon to listen a surprise music!
